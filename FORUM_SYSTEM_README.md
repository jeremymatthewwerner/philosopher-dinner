## 🎯 Forum Creation Process

The **Forum Creation Agent** guides you through an interactive process:

1. **Topic Selection**: Describe what you want to explore
2. **Thinker Recommendations**: AI suggests relevant philosophers
3. **Mode Selection**: Choose between Consensus, Debate, or Exploration
4. **Participant Curation**: Select 3-5 thinkers for optimal discussion
5. **Forum Launch**: Your custom forum is created and ready

### Example Creation Flow
```
User: "I want to explore the nature of free will"

Forum Creator: I can see you're interested in free will! This touches on 
consciousness, determinism, and moral responsibility.

For this discussion, I recommend:
1. **Immanuel Kant** - Developed ideas about autonomy and moral freedom
2. **David Hume** - Explored the relationship between causation and choice  
3. **Friedrich Nietzsche** - Challenged traditional notions of free will
4. **René Descartes** - Examined the mind's relationship to physical causation
