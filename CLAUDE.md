# Claude Context Memory

## Project: Philosopher Dinner
Multi-agent philosophy forum using LangGraph where AI agents embody famous philosophers, mathematicians, and thinkers to engage in group discussions.

## Current Progress
- âœ… Created specifications (SPECIFICATION.md, PROJECT_SPEC.md)
- âœ… Researched LangGraph multi-agent patterns (LANGGRAPH_RESEARCH.md)
- âœ… Set up GitHub repo: https://github.com/jeremymatthewwerner/philosopher-dinner
- âœ… Configured development environment (VS Code, venv, requirements.txt)
- âœ… Configured Claude Code settings for maximum permissions
- âœ… Designed system architecture (ARCHITECTURE.md)
- âœ… Built core LangGraph structure with state management
- âœ… Implemented Socrates agent with authentic personality and Socratic method
- âœ… Created LangGraph orchestrator for conversation flow
- âœ… Built CLI interface for human-agent interaction
- âœ… Tested basic functionality - all core components working!
- âœ… Fixed LangGraph recursion issues and achieved full integration
- âœ… Created comprehensive testing and debugging tools
- âœ… Built multiple interactive chat interfaces
- âœ… Validated authentic Socratic dialogue with proper questioning method
- âœ… All systems operational - ready for philosophical conversations!
- âœ… Built comprehensive automated testing system to catch bugs proactively
- âœ… Fixed help command bug discovered during testing
- âœ… Created bug prevention system with full test coverage
- ðŸ”„ **NEXT**: Add more philosopher agents (Aristotle, Kant, Nietzsche) and Oracle agent

## Key Design Decisions
- **Framework**: LangGraph for multi-agent coordination
- **Agents**: 3-5 philosophers per forum + Oracle agent for fact-checking
- **Participation**: Organic with smart coordination, topic-based activation
- **Memory**: ChromaDB for long-term storage + conversation memory
- **Forum Modes**: Consensus, Debate, or Exploration
- **Personas**: Historical figures, schools of thought, cross-disciplinary thinkers

## Technical Stack
- LangGraph: Graph-based multi-agent orchestration
- ChromaDB: Local vector database for memory
- MCP: Tool access and research
- Python CLI: Rich terminal interface

## Current Session Context
Completed full implementation of Philosopher Dinner system. Created comprehensive README.md that explains the project, its educational value, and how to use it. README will be maintained and updated as new features are added.

## README Maintenance
The README.md file should be updated whenever:
- New philosopher agents are added
- New features or interfaces are implemented  
- System requirements change
- Installation process changes
- New educational resources are discovered
- Roadmap milestones are completed
