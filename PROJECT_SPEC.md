# Multi-Agent Philosophy Forum System

## Project Overview
A command-line chat interface that enables conversations with multiple AI agents representing different philosophers, mathematicians, and schools of thought. This system serves as a learning platform for modern multi-agent programming techniques.

## Core Concept
- **Philosophy Forums**: Multiple persistent chat rooms, each with different collections of philosophical agents
- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Agents communicate with each other and the human in real-time group chat format
- **Persona-Based Agents**: Each agent embodies a specific philosopher, thinker, or school of thought with authentic worldviews and communication styles
- **Educational Focus**: Implement cutting-edge agentic programming patterns and frameworks

## Key Features

### 1. Forum Management
- Create and switch between different "philosopher forums"
- Each forum maintains its own agent composition and conversation history
- Persistent storage of all forum states

### 2. Agent System
- **Personas**: Real historical figures (Socrates, Kant, Nietzsche, etc.) or schools of thought (Stoicism, Existentialism, etc.)
- **Authentic Behavior**: Agents research and embody their assigned persona's worldview, argumentation style, and philosophical positions
- **Group Dynamics**: All agents participate simultaneously in conversations, responding to both human inputs and other agents

### 3. Advanced Agent Architecture
- **Long-term Memory**: Agents remember previous conversations and build on past discussions
- **Internal Planning**: Agents maintain their own thought processes and planning systems
- **MCP Integration**: Use Model Context Protocol for information access and tool usage
- **Modern Frameworks**: Leverage latest multi-agent collaboration libraries

### 4. Conversation Persistence
- **Markdown Logs**: Human-readable conversation history with timestamps
- **Agent Thinking**: Display internal agent deliberation in lighter text
- **Searchable History**: Easy access to previous discussions and philosophical exchanges

## Technical Requirements

### Frameworks to Explore
- Latest multi-agent communication frameworks (2024/2025)
- Advanced agent memory systems
- Real-time collaboration protocols
- Modern Python async/await patterns

### MCP Usage
- Research persona information (biographical, philosophical positions)
- Access external knowledge sources
- Integrate with additional tools as needed

## Initial Questions for Refinement

1. **Agent Composition**: How many agents per forum? Fixed or configurable?
2. **Conversation Flow**: Should agents respond in turns or more organically?
3. **Persona Depth**: How detailed should the research and persona embodiment be?
4. **Technical Stack**: Preferences for specific frameworks or libraries?
5. **Interface Design**: Terminal UI preferences (rich text, colors, formatting)?

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Specification and Planning
- **Next Steps**: Iterate on requirements, research frameworks, design architecture
